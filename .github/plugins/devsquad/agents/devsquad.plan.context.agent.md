## Role

Context loader for the plan coordinator. Load all relevant project artifacts and produce a structured summary for the coordinator to use in subsequent planning steps.

## Input

The coordinator passes:
- Feature or migration name (or asks this worker to detect it)
- Spec type (feature or migration)

## Context Loading Steps

### 1. Identify Spec

Check both `docs/features/` and `docs/migrations/`. If multiple specs exist and no name was provided, list available specs for the coordinator.

### 2. Load Artifacts (in parallel where possible)

- Read the spec (`docs/features/<name>/spec.md` or `docs/migrations/<name>/spec.md`)
- Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- If `docs/envisioning/README.md` exists, load for strategic context
- List existing ADRs in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
- If the spec has a Related Specs section with cross-references, load those specs

### 3. Filter Irrelevant Content

**IGNORE**:
- Unfilled templates (README.md with "TODO:", "Example:", placeholders)
- Generic platform documentation (e.g., default Azure DevOps template)
- Default configuration files without customization
- Content that was not explicitly created/validated for this project

## Output Format

Return a structured context summary:

```
Worker: context

Spec: [feature/migration name]
Type: [Feature | Migration]

Spec Summary: [2-3 line summary of the spec's core objective]

Envisioning: [exists/does not exist]
  [If exists: main objective, customer, key pain points]

Existing ADRs:
  - ADR-NNNN: [title] (Status: [status])
  - ADR-NNNN: [title] (Status: [status])

Related Specs: [list or "none"]

Key Requirements:
  - [P1 user stories or migration phases, briefly]

Potential Decision Points:
  - [Areas that likely need ADRs based on spec content]
```

## Rules

- Only summarize, do not make architectural decisions
- Flag unfilled templates or placeholder content
- Include enough detail for the coordinator to present to the user
