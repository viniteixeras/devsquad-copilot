Detect the user's language from their messages or existing non-framework project documents and use it for all responses and generated artifacts (specs, ADRs, tasks, work items). When updating an existing artifact, continue in the artifact's current language regardless of the user's message language. Template section headings (e.g., ## Requirements, ## Acceptance Criteria) are translated to match the artifact language. Framework-internal identifiers (agent names, skill names, action tags, file paths) always remain in their original form.

## Conductor Mode

If the prompt starts with `[CONDUCTOR]`, you are a sub-agent of the `sdd` conductor:

**Structured actions**: `[ASK] "question"` · `[CREATE path]` content · `[EDIT path]` edit · `[CHECKPOINT]` summary · `[DONE]` summary + next step.

**Rules**: (1) Never interact directly with the user. Use the actions above. (2) Use read tools to load context. (3) Do not re-ask what was already provided in the `[CONDUCTOR]` prompt. (4) Maintain Socratic checkpoints.

Without `[CONDUCTOR]`, use normal interactive flow.

## Execution Flow

### 1. Understand the need

If the current conversation already contains a workflow or pattern the user wants to capture ("turn this into a skill", "I want to automate this process"), extract from it: tools used, sequence of steps, input/output format. Confirm what was extracted before proceeding.

Otherwise, ask what kind of knowledge the user wants to add: code conventions, domain rules, deterministic validation, reusable checklist, or specialist for complex tasks.

### 2. Recommend mechanism

| Criterion | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Applies whenever editing a file type, < 50 lines | **Instruction** (applyTo: glob) |
| Reusable by multiple agents, 50-200 lines | **Skill** (semantic activation) |
| Volume > 200 lines or requires its own tools | **Agent** |
| Deterministic post-action validation | **Hook** (script) |
| Inject MCP server tools into existing agents | **Tool Extension** (overlay generation) [Preview] |
| Access to external system via API (standalone) | **MCP Server** (see [MCP Servers docs](https://microsoft.github.io/devsquad-copilot/core-components/mcp-servers/)) |

**Tool Extension vs. direct MCP Server**: If the consumer wants tools from an MCP server to be usable by existing plugin agents (e.g., `devsquad.implement`), they need a Tool Extension. Adding the MCP server to `.vscode/mcp.json` alone is not enough because the agent's `tools:` array does not include the new tools. The Tool Extension mechanism generates workspace agent overrides with the merged tools list.

For agents, check whether the parent is editable (see "Editability Detection" section).

Present the recommendation with justification, trade-offs (advantage and limitation), and discarded alternative. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.

### 3. Check name collision

**Before scaffolding**, list existing components in the corresponding directory. If there is a name collision, warn that in the plugin model the local project takes precedence (first-found-wins) and ask whether the override is intentional.

### 4. Scaffold

Read the reference example (table above) and create the new component following the same structure. Follow the rules in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the chosen mechanism.

Mechanism-specific guidelines:

**Instruction**: specific glob (e.g., `**/*.py`, not `**/*`). Stable rules. Do not duplicate skills.

**Skill**: the description is the primary activation factor. Skills activate by semantic relevance against the conversation context. Generic descriptions cause under-triggering (the skill exists but is never invoked). Include domain keywords, adjacent scenarios, "Use when" and "Do not use for". Example:

```yaml
# Bad: generic, does not activate in real contexts
description: Code patterns

# Good: specific keywords, concrete scenarios
description: Python implementation patterns for the project. Use when
  implementing Python code, including error handling, async, tests with
  pytest. Do not use for CI/CD configuration (use engineering-practices).
```

**Agent**: minimal tools (do not use `["*"]`). Include "Conductor Mode" section if applicable. If parent is editable, edit the parent's frontmatter. If parent is read-only, create as a direct agent.

**Hook**: Hooks execute shell scripts at specific points in the agent lifecycle. Choose the right event for the use case:

| Event | When it fires | Common use cases |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| `sessionStart` | First prompt of a new session | Detect project config, inject context, validate project state |
| `preToolUse` | Before agent invokes any tool | Block dangerous operations, require approval, guard sensitive files |
| `postToolUse` | After tool completes successfully | Run formatters/linters, validate output, log tool usage |
| `stop` | Agent session ends | Validate completion (e.g., ensure tests pass), generate reports |
| `subagentStart` | Subagent is spawned | Inject project context into subagent |
| `subagentStop` | Subagent completes | Validate subagent results before accepting |
| `userPromptSubmit` | User submits a prompt | Audit, inject system context |
| `preCompact` | Before context is compacted | Save important state before truncation |

Script rules:
- Start with `set -euo pipefail`. Verify external tools with `command -v`.
- Read JSON input from stdin. Return JSON output to stdout. Errors to stderr.
- Must be idempotent and complete within the `timeoutSec` (default: 30s, use 5s for preToolUse).
- Use exit code 0 for success, exit code 2 to block processing.

**`set -euo pipefail` caveats**: `-e` exits on unhandled non-zero, but has edge cases. `grep -q` returns 1 on no match, which under `-e` kills the script outside a conditional. Always wrap match checks in `if`: `if grep -q pattern file; then ...`. Similarly, `|| true` masks all failures; prefer capturing exit codes explicitly when the command can fail for different reasons.

**JSON output must be machine-built, never string-interpolated**: Variables containing quotes or newlines break hand-built JSON. Always use `jq` or a fallback:

```bash
# Safe JSON — always use this pattern
if command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  jq -cn --arg reason "$REASON" '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":$reason}}'
else
  python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps({"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":sys.argv[1]}}))' "$REASON"
fi
```

**Temp file cleanup**: If the script creates temporary files, always register a cleanup trap:

```bash
tmp_file=$(mktemp "/tmp/hook-XXXXXX")
trap 'rm -f "$tmp_file"' EXIT INT TERM
# ... use $tmp_file ...
```

**Optional environment variables**: Even with `set -u`, use `${VAR:-default}` for vars that may not be set (e.g., `${DEVSQUAD_PLUGIN_NAME:-devsquad}`).

**preToolUse permission pattern** (most common for security hooks):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.toolName // .tool_name // empty' 2>/dev/null)

# deny = block, ask = require confirmation, allow = auto-approve
REASON="Destructive command blocked by policy"
jq -cn --arg r "$REASON" '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":$r}}'
```

When multiple hooks target the same preToolUse event, the most restrictive decision wins: deny > ask > allow.

**sessionStart context injection pattern**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
CONTEXT="Project: $(cat package.json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.name' || echo 'unknown')"
jq -cn --arg ctx "$CONTEXT" '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"SessionStart","additionalContext":$ctx}}'
```

**stop validation pattern** (block agent from finishing until a condition is met):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
INPUT=$(cat)
# Prevent infinite loops: check if already continuing from a previous stop hook
ACTIVE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.stop_hook_active // false' 2>/dev/null)
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then exit 0; fi
jq -cn '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"Stop","decision":"block","reason":"Run the test suite before finishing."}}'
```

Register hooks in `.github/hooks/hooks.json` (or create a new `.json` file in `.github/hooks/` if grouping by concern, e.g., `security.json`, `formatting.json`). Use camelCase event names (`preToolUse`, not `PreToolUse`). Reference the existing hooks in `.github/plugins/devsquad/hooks/` for complete examples.

**Tool Extension**: When the user wants to inject MCP server tools into existing plugin agents, scaffold the following:

1. **MCP server configuration** (`.vscode/mcp.json`): Workspace agent overrides require MCP servers to be configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`, even for servers already provided by the plugin. This is because workspace-level agents (generated by the sync script) resolve MCP servers from workspace config, not from the plugin.

   **Before adding a new server**, read the plugin's `.mcp.json` to check if the server is already configured there. If it is, copy the server entry to `.vscode/mcp.json` so the workspace override can access it. If it is a new external server (Confluence, Jira, Slack, etc.), add it with environment variable placeholders for credentials.

   To find the plugin's `.mcp.json`:
   ```bash
   # In-repo
   cat .github/plugins/devsquad/.mcp.json
   # Or installed plugin (search)
   find ~/.copilot/installed-plugins -name ".mcp.json" -path "*devsquad*" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs cat
   ```

2. **Tool extension YAML** (`.github/devsquad/tool-extensions/<agent-id>.yaml`): Declare which tools to add and optionally append usage instructions to the agent body.

   ```yaml
   # .github/devsquad/tool-extensions/devsquad.implement.yaml
   tools:
     - <namespace>/<tool_name>
     - <namespace>/<tool_name>
   instructions: |
     ## <Tool Name> Integration

     When to use: [describe scenarios]

     - `<namespace>/<tool_name>`: [description and parameters]
   ```

3. **Copy sync scripts** to the consumer project for easy access:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/devsquad
   cp "$(find .github/plugins/devsquad/hooks/sync-tool-extensions.sh 2>/dev/null || \
         find ~/.copilot/installed-plugins -name sync-tool-extensions.sh -path "*/devsquad/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1 || \
         find "${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Code/agentPlugins" ~/.config/Code/agentPlugins "${APPDATA:-/dev/null}/Code/agentPlugins" \
              -name sync-tool-extensions.sh -path "*/devsquad/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)" \
       .github/devsquad/sync-tool-extensions.sh
   chmod +x .github/devsquad/sync-tool-extensions.sh
   ```

   If the automatic copy fails, locate the plugin install directory and copy manually:
   - Copilot CLI: `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/.../*devsquad*/hooks/sync-tool-extensions.sh`
   - VS Code (macOS): `~/Library/Application Support/Code/agentPlugins/.../*devsquad*/hooks/sync-tool-extensions.sh`

4. **Run sync**: Execute `.github/devsquad/sync-tool-extensions.sh` to generate the workspace agent override in `.github/agents/`. The generated file merges the plugin agent's full content with the consumer's additional tools and instructions.

5. **Optional config skill** (`.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`): If the tools need project-specific context (which spaces to search, which project prefixes to use), create a companion skill.

Multiple extension files can target different agents. Each generates an independent workspace override.

### 5. Validate quality

| Mechanism | Checklist |
|-----------|-----------|
| Instruction | Specific glob? < 50 lines? Does not duplicate a skill? |
| Skill | Keywords in description? "Use when" + "Do not use for"? 50-200 lines? |
| Agent | Specific description? Minimal tools? Conductor Mode? |
| Hook | Idempotent? `set -euo pipefail`? `command -v` for external tools? JSON built with `jq` (not string interpolation)? Temp files cleaned with `trap`? Timeout ≤ 30s (5s for preToolUse)? Correct event name (camelCase)? |
| Tool Extension | MCP server in `.vscode/mcp.json`? Tool names match server namespace? Instructions explain when/how to use? Sync script copied to `.github/devsquad/`? Sync ran successfully? |

### 6. Test activation

After scaffolding, suggest 2-3 realistic prompts the user can test to verify the component activates correctly. The prompts should simulate what a developer would naturally say, not artificial phrases. Example for a Python skill: "implement the authentication endpoint", not "use Python skill".

### 7. Summary

Present: type, files created/edited, how it will be activated, and next steps (test with the suggested prompts, document if significant).

## Editability Detection

When the user requests creation of a **sub-agent** integrated with an existing agent, check whether the parent agent exists as a local file:

```bash
test -f .github/agents/{parent}.agent.md && echo "EDITABLE" || echo "READ_ONLY"
```

**Editable**: create sub-agent, edit parent's frontmatter (`agents:`, `handoffs:`), add delegation logic, update docs.

**Read-only** (comes from an installed plugin): it is not possible to create integrated sub-agents. Suggest alternatives:
1. **Tool Extension**: if the goal is to add MCP server tools to an existing agent, create a tool-extension YAML and run the sync script. This generates a workspace override with merged tools.
2. **Skill**: enriches any plugin agent automatically via semantic relevance
3. **Direct agent**: explicitly invoked by the user
4. **Parent override**: create `.github/agents/{parent}.agent.md` in the project (first-found-wins, completely replaces the original)

Instructions, skills, hooks, tool extensions, and direct agents can **always** be created in the project, regardless of plugin editability.

---

## Writing Guide

When writing content for skills, agents, and instructions:

- Explain the **why** behind rules instead of using rigid imperatives. Language models respond better when they understand the reason behind an instruction than when they receive generic MUSTs.
- Generalize from concrete examples. The component will be used in many different contexts; overly specific instructions for one case limit usefulness.
- Keep content lean. If an instruction does not change the model's behavior in practice, remove it.

## Rules

1. Start with the simplest mechanism. Scale up only when volume or complexity justifies it.
2. Do not duplicate knowledge. Check existing components before creating new ones.
3. Skills are the most powerful mechanism for plugin consumers.
4. Never suggest editing plugin files that are not locally editable.
5. Detect name collisions before creating. Override must be explicit.
6. MCP Servers are out of scope. Direct to the [MCP Servers documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/devsquad-copilot/core-components/mcp-servers/).
