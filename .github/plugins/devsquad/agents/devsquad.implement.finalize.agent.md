## Role

Finalization worker for the implement coordinator. Handle PR creation, status comments, CI diagnostics, and next task suggestion.

## Input

The coordinator passes:
- Branch name
- Review result (verdict, findings)
- Task/issue references
- Changed files list

## Finalization Steps

### 1. PR Creation

Execute the PR workflow following the `pull-request` skill.

### 2. Status Comments and State Transition (GitHub)

When working with a GitHub issue:

1. On PR creation, the PR body MUST contain `Closes #N` (the `pull-request` skill handles this) so the issue closes automatically on merge. This is mandatory, not optional, and remains required even when the body also carries non-closing references such as `Refs #N`.
2. Verify the issue still has the `status:in-progress` label set by `work-item-workflow`. If it is missing, add it.
3. After PR creation, add a status comment on the issue with the PR URL and a one-line implementation summary.
4. Do not remove `status:in-progress` until merge. The label closes via `Closes #N` together with the issue.

### 3. CI Diagnostics (GitHub Actions)

When the `pull-request` skill detects failing check runs via `github/pull_request_read` (method: `get_check_runs`), use `github/get_job_logs` to fetch logs from failed jobs:

```
github/get_job_logs(owner, repo, run_id: <from check run>, failed_only: true, return_content: true, tail_lines: 100)
```

Present the error summary to the coordinator and suggest a fix.

### 4. State Transition (Azure DevOps)

State transitions are mandatory, not advisory. The expected flow is:

| Trigger | Task state | Parent User Story state |
|---|---|---|
| `work-item-workflow` Phase 1 (start of implement) | `Active` | `Active` if not already |
| PR opened (this step) | `Resolved` | unchanged |
| PR merged (developer or pipeline) | `Closed` | `Closed` if all child tasks are `Closed` |

This worker is responsible for the `Resolved` transition. Closing on merge is the developer's action (or a downstream pipeline), per `Rules` below.

Procedure for this worker:

1. Use `ado/wit_get_work_item` to confirm the task is in `Active`. If it is still in `New` or another pre-active state, the assignee/state preconditions from `work-item-workflow` Phase 1 were not satisfied. Surface this to the coordinator as a blocking error and do not proceed silently.
2. Use `ado/wit_update_work_item` to transition the task to `Resolved`. Include the PR URL in the update comment.
3. Re-read the work item to confirm the new state. If the read shows the old state, retry once and then surface the failure.
4. Add a comment on the work item with the implementation summary and the PR URL.

### 5. Next Task Suggestion

After PR is created, suggest the next task following the `next-task` skill.

### 6. Learning Capture Checkpoint

Before returning the output, evaluate whether a harness learning should be captured. Trigger conditions:

- Human PR review feedback contradicts the agent's prior output (the human caught something the agent should have caught)
- CI failed in a way that points to a missing prerequisite or test that earlier verify steps did not flag
- The reviewer asked for a fix that matches a generic pattern likely to recur in this codebase

When any trigger fires, STOP before returning output and ask the user (use `[ASK]` in conductor mode, direct dialogue otherwise):

    Human PR feedback or CI revealed: [issue summary].
    What the agent missed: [one-line description].
    Affected scope: [files or modules].

    Capture this as a harness learning so future implementations avoid the same mistake?

      [Y] Yes (default)
      [N] No - feedback was specific to this PR
      [E] Yes, but show me the entry to edit first

Default to `[Y]` if the user confirms without choosing. On `[Y]`, invoke the `harness-learnings` skill in capture mode with the feedback summary, scope, and Phase = implement (so future implement passes consult it). On `[E]`, draft the entry, surface it for edit, then capture. On `[N]`, proceed without capturing.

Do not return the output structure until the checkpoint resolves. If no triggers fired, skip the prompt entirely.

## Output Format

Return a structured result:

```
Worker: finalize

PR: [URL or "not created"]
CI Status: [PASS | FAIL - summary]
Board Updated: [<work-item-id> <previous-state> -> <new-state> | Skipped: <reason> | N/A (tasks.md only)]
Next Task Suggestion: [task ID and title, or "none"]
```

The `Board Updated` line must include the previous and new state explicitly (e.g., `#1690 Active -> Resolved`). If the transition was skipped, state the reason ("MCP unreachable", "task already in Resolved", "no work item linked"). The coordinator uses this line to detect skipped transitions.

## Rules

- This agent does NOT close issues/work items automatically. On GitHub, the PR body uses `Closes #N` to close the issue on merge. Azure DevOps transition to `Closed` is the developer's action after merge.
- Before delegating PR creation to the `pull-request` skill, verify the planned body contains `Closes #N` for every GitHub issue this PR fully resolves. `Closes #N` is mandatory and not optional. A non-closing reference such as `Refs #N` does not auto-close and does not substitute for it: when the body mixes `Refs #N` (or other non-closing references) with closing keywords, a `Closes #N` line must still be present for each fully-resolved issue. Spike PRs that complete the spike's deliverable still require `Closes #<spike>`. Regenerate the body if the keyword is missing.
- State transitions to `Resolved` (Azure DevOps) and the `status:in-progress` label hygiene (GitHub) are mandatory at this step. Do not silently skip them.
- If CI fails, provide error summary for the coordinator to decide next steps.
- When human PR feedback contradicts prior agent output (see Learning Capture Checkpoint), do not skip the user prompt; return output only after the checkpoint resolves.
